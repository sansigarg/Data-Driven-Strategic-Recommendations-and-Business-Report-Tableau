# Data-Driven-Strategic-Recommendations-and-Business-Report-Tableau-

## Project Overview:

In this project, we delve into the world of data-driven decision-making, leveraging comprehensive data analysis and visualization techniques. We explore the "Hult â€“ Superstore.xlsx" dataset to gain insights into the performance of sub-categories within the Hult Superstore. Our analysis is geared towards providing strategic recommendations to enhance business outcomes.

## Key Insights:

Here are some of the key insights from our analysis:

1. The top 5 subcategories, ranked by quantity sold, are Binders, Paper, Art, Accessories, and Furnishings.
2. Binders have the highest quantity sold with a 3-year cumulative growth rate of 23.35% but suffer from a low profit margin due to high discounts.
3. Paper boasts a high profit margin of 43.66%, but its sales value is lower due to a lower average selling price.
4. Accessories have strong potential, with a high quantity CAGR of 22.21% and a higher average selling price.
5. Our subcategory analysis, based on sales value and profit margin, highlights Accessories as having the most potential.
6. California, within the West region, performs exceptionally well and presents an opportunity for increased marketing efforts.

## Business Insights:

Our analysis yields several strategic recommendations:

1. Focus on optimizing Binders' profitability by reducing discounts while maintaining customer interest.
2. Invest marketing resources in Accessories due to its high potential for growth.
3. Consider discontinuing Machines and Supplies due to low orders and negative profits.
4. Invest in Copiers to leverage their high profit margin and average selling price.
